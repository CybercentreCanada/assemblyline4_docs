### Submission Section

At the heart of Assemblyline's functionality is the submission section, where users can submit files, URLs, or hashes for malware analysis. This section is central to the interface, allowing users to initiate the analysis process quickly and efficiently.

- **Classification Picker**: Before making a submission, you can use the classification picker to specify the desired classification level for your analysis.

### Roles and Permissions

Assemblyline uses role-based access controls (RBAC) to manage user permissions. Roles define what actions users can perform in the system, ensuring fine-grained control over functionalities.

### API Quotas

Each user has specific quotas applied to their account, such as the number of processes interacting with the API simultaneously and the number of parallel submissions. These quotas help manage system resources effectively.

### Account Security

Account security is important in Assemblyline. The "Manage Account" view provides several security options:
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhance security by enabling MFA.
- **API Key Management**: Generate and manage API keys, essential for automated interactions with the Assemblyline API via scripts or other tools.

## AccountÂ Settings

Navigate to the "Account Settings" view to customize your Assemblyline experience:

### Submission Options
Set default values for frequently used submission settings to streamline your workflow. For example:
- **Days to Live**: Specify the default number of days that submissions will be retained in the system. This is crucial for managing data lifecycle and compliance with organizational policies.
- **Classification**: Set a default classification for your submissions, ensuring they adhere to your organization's data handling requirements.

![Account Settings View, Submission Options](./images/account_settings_submission_options.png)

### Interface Options
Configure interface preferences, including visual settings and file encoding options, to optimize your user experience:

  ![Account Settings View, Interface Options, and Default SHA256 Sources](./images/account_settings_interface_and_sources.png)

- **File Encoding**: This setting is particularly important if you are working in an environment with antivirus software. By setting the encoding of files downloaded from Assemblyline to a format like CaRT or a password-protected ZIP, you can prevent the antivirus software from immediately deleting these files. This ensures that the downloaded files are available for your analysis without interference.

  ![File Encoding](./images/file_encoding.png)

#### Default Service Selection
If you often submit to the same services, set a default service set and default service parameters to save time:
  ![Account Settings View, Default Service Selection](./images/default_service_selection.png)
  ![Account Settings View, Default Service Parameters](./images/default_service_parameters.png)

## Submissions

Use the side menu option "Submissions" to view and manage all submissions made to the system.

![Submissions View](./images/submissions.png)

### Filtering and Viewing Submissions

- **Filter Bar**: Use the filter bar above the table to narrow down your submissions.
- **Preset Queries**: Use icons to filter by user, completed submissions, or malicious submissions.

### Submission Report View

Dive into a particular submission by selecting its card in the table, bringing you to the ["Submission Report" view](../../user_manual/results#submission-report). This view provides a condensed report of the analysis, offering a streamlined summary that is easier to digest.

## Alerts

The Alerts section in Assemblyline is dedicated to managing alerts generated when submissions meet certain criteria, often exceeding a score threshold. These alerts can be assigned, triaged, and resolved by analysts.

### Alerts Overview

The "Alerts" page provides a comprehensive view of all alerts. You can view, filter, and manage alerts effectively using the built-in tools.

![Alerts view](./images/alerts.png)

### Filtering Alerts

Use the filter bar to perform a Lucene query to narrow down specific alerts. The filter bar allows you to specify detailed search criteria to find the alerts relevant to your needs.

![Alerts filter](./images/alerts_filter.png)

Additionally, you can set your favorite queries for quick access. This makes it easier to run frequently used searches without re-entering the criteria each time.

![Create a Favourite Alert Query](./images/favourite_alert.png){: .center }

After performing a query, you can further filter the results to hone in on the most important alerts.

![Filter the query results](./images/alert_filter.png){: .center }

### Workflow Actions

Workflows allow you to automate specific actions on alerts based on predefined criteria. For example, you might want to label all alerts with a verdict of malicious and containing the word "invoice" as "PHISHING" for further analysis.

From the Alerts page, you can perform two types of workflow actions:

1. **Create a Persistent New Workflow**: Click the "Create a new workflow" button. This option allows you to add a new named workflow to the system. When creating a new workflow, you can specify if it should be applied to all existing alerts that match the supplied filter. Once created, this workflow is saved and will continuously be applied to any new alerts that match the criteria. The workflow persists in the system and can be managed from the "Manage Workflows" page.

   ![Perform a workflow action on alerts](./images/alert_new_workflow.png){: .center }

2. **Apply an Ephemeral Workflow Action Immediately**: Click the "Workflow actions" button to apply a new workflow action to existing alerts based on the current query filter. Unlike creating a new persistent workflow, this action is not saved as a workflow in the system. Instead, it is a one-time action that is only applied to matching existing alerts.

   ![Phishing invoice workflow example](./images/phishing_workflow_example.png){: .center }

Within a workflow action, you can assign various actions to alerts that meet the criteria:
- **Assign a Status**: Set the status of an alert (e.g., MALICIOUS, NON-MALICIOUS, ASSESS, TRIAGE).
- **Assign a Priority**: Set the priority level of the alert (e.g., LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL).
- **Assign a Label**: Apply a label to categorize the alert (e.g., PHISHING, FALSE_POSITIVE, etc.).

These workflow actions ensure alerts are handled consistently and according to your organization's policies.

### Viewing Alert Details

Select an alert card to view detailed information about the alert:

![Alert details](./images/alert_details.png)

The alert details include:
- **Classification**: The classification level of the alert.
- **Alert Information**: Basic information about the alert.
- **Verdict and Labels**: The system's verdict and applicable labels.
- **File Details**: Information about the file, including name, type, size, and hashes.
- **Metadata and Indicators**: Metadata and any indicators of compromise or heuristics found.

### Alert Management Tools

Within the alert details view, triage analysts have several important tools at their disposal:

![Alert Triage Buttons](./images/alert_triage_buttons.png){: .center }

- **View History**: Check the audit history of an alert, displaying all changes made to the alert. This includes changes related to priority, status, and the addition or removal of labels. Each change is timestamped and indicates whether the change was made by a workflow or a user.

  ![Alert History](./images/alert_history.png)

- **Show All Alerts From Group**: Apply a filter to the current query to view all alerts from the same group as the selected alert.

  ![Show all alerts from group](./images/alerts_by_group.png){: .center }

- **Take Ownership**: Assign the alert to your user account for triage.

  ![Take ownership view](./images/take_ownership.png){: .center }

- **Go to Related Submission**: Navigate to the submission that raised the alert.
- **Perform a Workflow Action**: Apply a workflow action to alerts in the same group.
- **Set Alert Verdict**: Manually set the alert verdict to non-malicious or malicious. This feature provides analysts with the ability to complement the system verdict. It is especially useful in cases where Assemblyline provides a false-positive verdict, allowing the analyst to confirm and mark the alert as a false-positive, and vice versa.

### Navigation Arrows

Navigate through alerts easily with the left and right arrows to cycle through available alerts.
