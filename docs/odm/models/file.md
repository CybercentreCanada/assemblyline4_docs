## LabelCategories
Structured categorization model for labels applied to a file.

LabelCategories provide a systematic approach to classifying the characteristics and threat indicators of a file. This model organizes labels into distinct categories such as informational tags, technical techniques, and attribution links. By categorizing labels, analysts can efficiently navigate and assess the nature and potential threats associated with a file, streamlining the malware analysis process.

## URIInfo
Detailed breakdown model of a file's Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

URIInfo dissects a file's URI into its fundamental components, providing granular data for advanced search and identification. This includes the scheme, network location, path, and other elements such as query parameters and fragments. By parsing these components, Assemblyline allows for a more nuanced analysis of the source and context of a file, which is essential for forensic investigations and threat intelligence gathering.

Each of these descriptions aims to provide a clearer understanding of the purpose and utility of the respective models within Assemblyline, highlighting their roles in the broader context of malware analysis and cyber security operations.
