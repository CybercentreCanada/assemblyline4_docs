## Basic Field Types
Here is a table of the basic types of fields in our data models and what they're used for:

|Name|Description|
|:---|:----------|
| `Any` | A field that can hold any value whatsoever but which is stored as a Keyword in the datastore index. |
| `Boolean` | A field storing a boolean value. |
| `Classification` | A field storing access control classification. |
| `ClassificationString` | A field storing the classification as a string only. |
| `Compound` | A field used to wrap Model classes and treat them as fields. |
| `Date` | A field storing a datetime value. |
| `Domain` | A field storing a network domain value. |
| `Email` | A field storing an email address value. |
| `EmptyableKeyword` | A keyword which allow to differentiate between empty and None values. |
| `Enum` | A field storing a short string that has predefined list of possible values. |
| `FlattenedListObject` | A field storing a flattened list object. |
| `FlattenedObject` | A field storing a flattened object. |
| `Float` | A field storing a floating point value. |
| `IP` | A field storing a network IP value. |
| `IndexText` | A special field with special processing rules to simplify searching. |
| `Integer` | A field storing an integer value. |
| `Json` | A field storing serializeable structure with their JSON encoded representations.<br>An example of this is metadata |
| `Keyword` | A field storing a short string with a technical interpretation.<br>Examples: file hashes, service names, document IDs |
| `List` | A field storing a sequence of typed elements. |
| `MAC` | A field storing a MAC address value. |
| `MD5` | A field storing an MD5 hash of a file. |
| `Mapping` | A field storing a sequence of typed elements. |
| `Optional` | A wrapper field that allows simple types (int, float, bool) to take None values. |
| `PhoneNumber` | A field storing a phone number. |
| `Platform` | A field storing an OS platform value. |
| `Processor` | A field storing a processor value. |
| `SHA1` | A field storing an SHA1 hash of a file. |
| `SHA256` | A field storing an SHA256 hash of a file. |
| `SSDeepHash` | A field storing an SSDeepHash value. |
| `Text` | A field storing human-readable text data. |
| `URI` | A field storing a network URI value. |
| `URIPath` | A field storing a network URI path value. |
| `UUID` | A field storing an auto-generated unique ID if None is provided. |

## Field States
In each table, there will be a "Required" column with different states about the field's status:

|State|Description|
|:---|:----------|
|:material-checkbox-marked-outline: Yes|This field is required to be set in the model|
|:material-minus-box-outline: Optional|This field isn't required to be set in the model|
|:material-alert-box-outline: Deprecated|This field has been deprecated in the model. See field's description for more details.|

__Note__: Fields that are ":material-alert-box-outline: Deprecated" that are still shown in the docs will still work as expected but you're encouraged to update your configuration as soon as possible to avoid future deployment issues.
