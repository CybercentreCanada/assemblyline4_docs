## Appliance Installation

For this first public beta, the only installation we will support is the appliance installation (This can also be used for service development).

In this setup, AssemblyLine 4 will use all of the resources available on your machine for it's components. This can be deployed on any machine / VM that can run Docker containers. 

### Pre-requisites

We recommend that you run AssemblyLine on a system with the following minimal specs:

    Any linux distribution with a recent kernel (4.4+)
    4 Cores
    8 GB of Ram
    40 GB of disk space

#### Docker pre-installed on your machine
Appliance mode will use Docker to start Assemblyline therefore it will need to be installed on your machine. 

NOTE: `All instructions that follow need to be performed on the machine where Assemblyline will be installed.`

##### Installation of docker on Ubuntu (Recommended)
Follow these simple commands to get docker runnning on your machine:

    # Add docker repository
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

    # Install docker
    sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

    # Test docker installation
    sudo docker run hello-world

##### Installation of Docker on other linux distro

Follow instructions on Docker's website: [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

#### Add your proxy settings to docker (Optional)

Create `$HOME/.docker/config.json` file:

    mkdir -p ~/.docker/
    nano ~/.docker/config.json

    # Save your proxy settings inside the file
    {
        "proxies":
        {
            "default":
            {
                "httpProxy": "http://<PROXY_ADDRESS>:<PROXY_PORT>/",
                "httpsProxy": "http://<PROXY_ADDRESS>:<PROXY_PORT>/",
                "noProxy": "<YOUR_CUSTOM_PROXY_EXEMPTIONS>,localhost,127.0.0.1,minio,elasticsearch,redis,nginx,al_service_server,service-server,al_ui,al_socketio"
            }
        }
    }

Create systemd proxy setting file for docker:

    nano /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/https-proxy.conf

    # Save your proxy settings in the file

    [Service]

    Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://<PROXY_ADDRESS>:<PROXY_PORT>/" "HTTP_PROXY=http://<PROXY_ADDRESS>:<PROXY_PORT>/" "NO_PROXY=<YOUR_CUSTOM_PROXY_EXEMPTIONS>,localhost,127.0.0.1,minio,elasticsearch,redis,nginx,al_service_server,service-server,al_ui,al_socketio"

Reload docker and test:

    # Reload docker 
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart docker

    # Test systemd
    systemctl show --property=Environment docker

    # Test docker containers
    docker container run --rm busybox env

#### Docker-compose pre-installed on your computer
Installing docker-compose is done the same way on all Linux distros. Follow these simple instructions:

    # Install docker-compose
    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.5/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    
    # Test docker-compose installation
    docker-compose --version

For reference, here are the instructions on Docker's website: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Download installation files

Download installation files to your home directory:

    curl -L "https://assemblyline-support.s3.amazonaws.com/assemblyline4_beta_3.tar.gz" -o $HOME/assemblyline4_beta_3.tar.gz

Or you can manually download them and put them in the right spot:

[Download Beta](https://assemblyline-support.s3.amazonaws.com/assemblyline4_beta_3.tar.gz){: .btn .btn-primary .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 }

### Extract installation files

From now on, we will assume you've downloaded the file in your home directory.

Decompress the installation archive:

    tar zxvf $HOME/assemblyline4_beta_3.tar.gz

### Configure system

Generate a self-signed cert for your installation:

    openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout $HOME/assemblyline4_beta_3/config/nginx.key -out $HOME/assemblyline4_beta_3/config/nginx.crt -days 365 -subj "/C=CA/ST=Ontario/L=Ottawa/O=CCCS/CN=assemblyline.local"


(`Optional`) Edit the default passwords in the following two files:
    
    nano $HOME/assemblyline4_beta_3/.env
    nano $HOME/assemblyline4_beta_3/config/bootstrap.py

### Authentication (optional)

You are not obligated to use our internal authentificator to authenticate users. You can also use the following two:

#### LDAP Authentication (optional)

You can easily add authentication via your LDAP server by turning on and configuring the LDAP authentication module in the configuration file (`$HOME/assemblyline4_beta_3/config/config.yml`)

Here is a exemple configuration block to add to your configuration file that will allow you to connect to the docker-test-openldap server from: https://github.com/rroemhild/docker-test-openldap

    auth:
        internal:
            # Disable internal login, you could also leave it on if you want
            enabled: false
        ldap:
            # Enable LDAP
            enabled: true

            # DN of the group or the user who will get admin priviledges
            admin_dn: cn=admin_staff,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
            
            # Auto-create users if they are missing
            auto_create: true
            
            # Auto-sync LDAP values with the internal DB at each login
            auto_sync: false
            
            # URI to the LDAP server
            uri: ldaps://<ldap_ip_or_domain>:636
            
            # Base DN for the users
            base: ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
            
            # Field name for the uid
            uid_field: uid
            
            # How the group lookup is queried
            group_lookup_query: (&(objectClass=Group)(member=%s))
  
#### oAuth Authentication (optional)

You can now use an external service provider to authenticate your users by using the oAuth protocol. Simply turn on oAuth authentification by configuring the oAuth authentication module in the configuration file (`$HOME/assemblyline4_beta_3/config/config.yml`)

Here is a exemple configuration block to add to your configuration file that will allow you to connect to all 3 supported oAuth providers:

    auth:
        internal:
            # Disable internal login, you could also leave it on if you want
            enabled: false
        oauth:
            # Enable oAuth
            enabled: true

            # Setup the providers (You can just remove the ones you don't want)
            providers: 
                auth0:
                    # It is safe to auto-create users here 
                    # because it is your own oAuth tenant
                    auto_create: true
                    auto_sync: false

                    # Put your client ID and secret here
                    client_id: <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
                    client_secret: <YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
                    
                    # Set your tenant name in the following urls
                    access_token_url: https://<TENANT_NAME>.auth0.com/oauth/token
                    authorize_url: https://<TENANT_NAME>.auth0.com/authorize
                    api_base_url: https://<TENANT_NAME>.auth0.com/
                
                azure_ad:
                    # Be careful when you set auto-create here cause if you've
                    # set your client id to allow everyone, you'll give access
                    # to anyone that has a microsoft account...
                    auto_create: false
                    auto_sync: false

                    # Put your client ID and secret here 
                    client_id: <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
                    client_secret: <YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>

                google:
                    # Be careful when you set auto-create here cause if you've
                    # set your client id to allow everyone, you'll give access
                    # to anyone that has a google account...
                    auto_create: false
                    auto_sync: false

                    # Put your client ID and secret here 
                    client_id: <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
                    client_secret: <YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>


### Run docker_compose file
Every time you run docker-compose commands you must be in the directory were the compose file resides.

    cd $HOME/assemblyline4_beta_3/

Now you can start Assemblyline Beta

    sudo docker-compose pull
    sudo docker-compose up -d

Install services and `admin` user

    sudo docker-compose -f bootstrap-compose.yaml pull
    sudo docker-compose -f bootstrap-compose.yaml up -d 

### Assemblyline is started, now what? 

There is a few things you need to know now that you have an Assemblyline4 instance started

1. The bootstrap process for the first boot may take about 5 minutes to make sure everything is ready. 
2. The services will slowly be added to the system while the `bootstrap-compose.yaml` file gets executed.
3. You do not have to wait 30 minutes anymore to get the list of signatures, this process now only take a minute.
4. To get access to your beta instance just browse to `https://<IP_OF_YOUR_AL_INSTANCE>`. The default username/password to access the instance is `admin`/`admin`. (Note: If you changed the password in the `bootstrap.py` file, use this password instead)

#### Viewing logs
There is no logs centralization with this deployment but because everything runs on the same box you can leverage docker logging infrastructure.

To view logs for the core components:

    # From your docker-compose directory
    cd $HOME/assemblyline4_beta_3/

    # View all core-component logs
    sudo docker-compose logs

    # View logs for specific core component
    sudo docker-compose logs al_ui

    # Tail logs for a core component
    sudo docker-compose logs -f al_ui

Services are not loaded from your docker compose file, they are loaded by a component called `scaler`. To view their logs you must use docker directly.

    # list all loaded services
    sudo docker ps | grep "\-service\-"

    # View logs for a specific service
    sudo docker logs al_YARA_0

    # Tail logs for a sevice 
    sudo docker logs -f al_YARA_0

    # Going through a big log file using less
    sudo docker logs al_YARA_0 2>&1 | less

#### Access the Assemblyline CLI

To load the `Assemblyline CLI` you will need to hijack on of the running container. We recommended using the `updater` container.

    sudo docker exec -it assemblyline4_beta_3_al_updater_1 python -m assemblyline.run.cli
