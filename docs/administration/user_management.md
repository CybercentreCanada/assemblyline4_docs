## User list

The first page you will be taken to when loading the user management interface will list all the users of the system.

From this interface you can:

1. Page through the different users of the system
2. Filter the displayed users with the search bar
    * Assemblyline users can be searched using a Lucene query. As you start typing in the search box, the system will suggest to you fields that you can search into.
    * You can also use the quick filter buttons for pre-defined searches. These pre-defined searches will help you get started writing more complex user searches.
3. Add users to the system using the top right "*Add User*" button
4. View the detail of a user

## User detail

Once you click on a user in the user list, the detail view for that user will be shown.
