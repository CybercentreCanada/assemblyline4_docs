# RESTful API

When it is impossible to integrate your application using the dedicated python client, you can use Assemblyline's RESTful API to perform any task that you can think of.

## API documentation

Each instance of Assemblyline comes with its internal API documentation which can be viewed by browsing to [https://yourdomain/help/api](https://yourdomain/help/api)

## Connecting to the API

For easy integration, it is recommended that you generate an [API key](../key_generation) for the user who will perform RESTful queries. Otherwise, you will have to build yourself a library that will handle session cookies and XSRF tokens and you probably want something simpler.

### Using the API key

To use your newly created [API key](../key_generation) you can simply add the `X-USER` and `X-APIKEY` headers to your request and the system will identify you with that key at each request instead of relying on a session cookie.

!!! example

    Let's use a hypothetical [API key](../key_generation) to ask the system who we are. (Using the `/api/v4/user/whoami/` API)


    === "CURL"
        ``` shell 
        curl -X GET "https://yourdomain/api/v4/user/whoami/" \
            -H 'x-user: <your_user_id>' \
            -H 'x-apikey: <key_name:randomly_generated_password>' \
            -H 'accept: application/json'
        ```

    === "Javascript (fetch)"
        ``` javascript
        fetch(
        "https://yourdomain/api/v4/user/whoami/", 
        {
            "headers": {
            "accept": "application/json",
            "x-apikey": "<key_name:randomly_generated_password>",
            "x-user": "<your_user_id>"
            },
            "method": "GET"
        }
        );
        ```

    === "Python (requests)"
        ``` python
        import requests
        requests.get(
            "https://yourdomain/api/v4/user/whoami/", 
            headers={
                "x-user": "<your_user_id>", 
                "x-apikey": "<key_name:randomly_generated_password>", 
                "accept": "application/json"
            }
        )
        ```

## API Gotcha! 

!!! tip "Here is a list of the most common issues users are facing while using the API"

### Wrong content type

All Assemblyline APIs are built around receiving and returning JSON data. Do not forget to set your `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to `"application/json"` or you might encounter some issues.

### Trailing forward slash

All Assemblyline APIs end with a trailing forward slash `"/"`. Make sure that the API URL has it at the end of the URL otherwise you may get a `"Method not allowed"` error and you'll have issues figuring out why.
