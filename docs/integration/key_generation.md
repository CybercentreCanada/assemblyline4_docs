# Generating an API key

While integrating Assemblyline to another system, you should not save your username and password into another app. Instead, you should create an API Key with only the appropriate required for that specific integration.

Here is how to do this:

- [x] Login to Assemblyline's user interface with the user that will perform API requests
- [x] Click on your avatar in the top-right corner of the Assemblyline UI and select "Manage Account"
- [x] Scroll down to the bottom to the "Security" section and select "Manage API Keys"
- [x] Add the API Key name, select access privileges then click the "Add" button.
- [x] The API KEY will only be displayed once and can't be recovered. Copy it somewhere safe so that you can use it later.
- [x] Click the "Done" button.
