# Infrastructure

This section gives you a complete overview of all the different components of Assemblyline, so you have a better idea of what they are used for.

## Dependencies

The components listed here are external dependencies used by Assemblyline:

| Dependency | Description | |
|-|-|-|
| Docker | Docker is now at the heart of Assemblyline because all Assemblyline's components are now running as Docker containers. | [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/) |
| Kubernetes | For multi-computer installations, Assemblyline uses Kubernetes to deploy the different Docker containers and keep them healthy. | [https://kubernetes.io/](https://kubernetes.io/) |
| Helm | Helm is used to easily deploy and maintain our Kubernetes instance. | [https://helm.sh/](https://helm.sh/) |
| Elastic Stack | Assemblyline uses the full Elastic stack to store results, logs, metrics, and APMs. It consists of the following components: | [https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack) |
| | Elasticsearch | Elasticsearch is used for storing results, logs, and metrics of the system. It also provides search capability to Assemblyline. |
| | Kibana (optional) | Provides dashboards to monitor your Assemblyline cluster. |
| | APM (optional) | Gather Application Performance Metrics so that we can pinpoint potential performance issues with the system and fix them. |
| | Filebeat (optional) | Gather all the logs for the different components into Elasticsearch to be displayed in Kibana. |
| | Metricbeat (optional) | Gather metrics for the different hosts where the Docker containers are run. |
| Redis | We are using Redis for the queueing system, for messaging between the components, and as a remote data structure to keep multiple instances of a given component working in sync. | [https://redis.io/](https://redis.io/) |
| Nginx | Nginx is used by Assemblyline as a proxy to give the user access to the different user-facing components: UI, API, Socket Server, Kibana. | [https://www.nginx.com/](https://www.nginx.com/) |
| Minio | For our default file storage, we use Minio which perfectly replicates the Amazon S3 API and is built to work with Kubernetes. | [https://min.io/](https://min.io/) |

## Core Components

The components listed here are Assemblyline-made processes that perform various tasks in the system:

| Core components | Description | Link |
|-----------------|-------------|----|
| Alerter | Create alerts for the different submissions in the system. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-core/tree/master/assemblyline_core/alerter) |
| Dispatcher | Route the files in the system while a submission is taking place. Make sure all files during a submission are completed by all required services. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-core/tree/master/assemblyline_core/dispatching) |
| Expiry | Delete submissions and their results when their TTL (Time-to-live) expires. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-core/tree/master/assemblyline_core/expiry) |
| Frontend | Provides the user interface to interact with Assemblyline. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-ui-frontend) |
| Ingester | Move ingested files from the priority queues to the processing queues. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-core/tree/master/assemblyline_core/ingester) |
| Metrics Aggregator | Aggregate metrics of the different components in the system to save them into an ELK (Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana) stack. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-core/tree/master/assemblyline_core/metrics) |
| Metrics Heartbeat | Provide live metrics in the system for the dashboard. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-core/tree/master/assemblyline_core/metrics) |
| Scaler | Spin up and down services in the system depending on the load. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-core/tree/master/assemblyline_core/scaler) |
| Statistics Aggregator | Generate daily statistics about signatures and heuristics. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-core/tree/master/assemblyline_core/metrics) |
| Updater | Make sure the different services get their latest update files. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-core/tree/master/assemblyline_core/updater) |
| Workflow | Run the different workflows in the system and apply their labels, priority, and status. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-core/tree/master/assemblyline_core/workflow) |
| Service Server | Provides an API for services to get tasks and post their results. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-service-server) |
| UI / Socket Server | Provides the APIs and a socket.io interface to interact with Assemblyline. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-ui) |

## Service interfaces

The interfaces listed here are used by Assemblyline's services to process files, generate results, and communicate back to the Service Server:

| Service Interface | Description | Link |
|-------------------|-------------|------|
| Python 2 Compatibility Library | A library that gives services Python 2 compatibility. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-v4-p2compat) |
| Result | Class used by a service to generate results in the system. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-v4-service/blob/master/assemblyline_v4_service/common/result.py) |
| Service Base | Base Assemblyline service class. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-v4-service/blob/master/assemblyline_v4_service/common/base.py) |
| Service Request | Class that defines a request to scan a file for a given service. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-v4-service/blob/master/assemblyline_v4_service/common/request.py) |
| Task Handler | A Python wrapper that communicates with the service server to get a task, download files, and publish results. It communicates with the service via named pipes so that the service can execute the received tasks. | [Source code](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-service-client/tree/master/assemblyline_service_client) |
