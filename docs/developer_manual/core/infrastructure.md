| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Docker        | Docker is now at the heart of Assemblyline because all Assemblyline's components are now running as Docker containers.                                                            | [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)                                                                              |
| Kubernetes    | For multi-computer installations, Assemblyline uses Kubernetes to deploy the different Docker containers and keep them healthy.                                                   | [https://kubernetes.io/](https://kubernetes.io/)                                                                                |

## UI Plugins

The API may be extended via plugins. Plugins may be developed externally to Assemblyline to provide additional functionality. They must conform to the defined interface for their function.
Currently, the only type of plugin defined is for information enrichment from systems external to Assemblyline.

| Plugin Interface        | Description                                                                                               | Link                                                                                                             |
