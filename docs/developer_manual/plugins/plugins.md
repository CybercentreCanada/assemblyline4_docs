# Plugins

The API may be extended via plugins. Plugins may be developed externally to Assemblyline to provide additional functionality. They must conform the the defined interface for their function.

This section gives you an overview of why plugins exist and what they are used for.


## Why

Plugins are designed to enable interfacing and interoperability with other systems. This methoed allows for the de-coupleing of system specific code that is not core to Assemblyline and may not want to be enabled by all users.


## External Lookups

These plugins enable the querying of Assmebyline data in an external system and brining back the results.
