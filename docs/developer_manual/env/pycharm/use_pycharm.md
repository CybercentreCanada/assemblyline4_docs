# Use PyCharm

Here are some pointers on how to run most of the core components live in PyCharm when either your local or remote development VM is ready.

## Load docker-compose files

### Minimal Dependencies

When dependencies are loaded, you can launch any core components and their dependencies should be satisfied.

=== "PyCharm Professional"

    1. In your project file viewer
    2. Browse to ```assemblyline-base/dev/depends```
    3. Right-click on ```docker-compose-minimal.yml```
    4. Select ```Create 'depends/docker-compose...'```
    5. Click ```OK```
    6. You'll notice on the top right that a new Compose deployment has been created for dependencies. Hit the play button next to it to launch the containers.

    !!! tip
        From now on you can just select that Compose deployment for dependencies from the dropdown up top and hit the run button to launch it. It is good practice to Edit the configuration and give it a proper name.

=== "Docker-compose (PyCharm Community)"

    In a new terminal on the VM, run the following commands:

    ```shell
    cd ~/git/alv4/assemblyline-base/dev/depends/
    sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-minimal.yml up
    ```

    !!! tip
        This will take over the terminal and the logs will be displayed there. Hit ```ctrl-c``` when you want to shut the containers down.

    If you close the terminal and the containers keep running, run the following commands to shut down the containers:

    ```shell
    cd ~/git/alv4/assemblyline-base/dev/depends/
    sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-minimal.yml down
    ```

### Core services

Core services depend on the dependencies in the `docker-compose` file. When the core services are loaded you should be able to point a browser at ```https://IP_OF_VM``` and you'll be greeted with a working version of Assemblyline with no services configured.

!!! note
    Default admin user credentials are:

    * Username: ```admin```
    * Password: ```admin```

=== "PyCharm Professional"

    1. In your project file viewer
    2. Browse to `assemblyline-base/dev/core`
    3. Right-click on `docker-compose.yml`
    4. Select `Create 'core: Compose Deploy...'`
    5. Click `OK`
    6. You'll notice on the top right that a new Compose deployment has been created for core services, hit the play button next to it to launch the containers.

    !!! tip
        From now on you can just select that Compose deployment for core components from the dropdown up top and hit the run button to launch it. It is good practice to Edit the configuration and give it a proper name.

=== "Docker-compose (PyCharm Community)"

    In a new terminal on the VM, run the following commands:
    ```shell
    cd ~/git/alv4/assemblyline-base/dev/core/
    sudo docker-compose up
    ```

    !!! tip
        This will take over the terminal and the logs will be displayed there. Hit ```ctrl-c``` when you want to shut the containers down.

    If you close the terminal and the containers keep running, run the following commands to shut down the containers:
    ```shell
    cd ~/git/alv4/assemblyline-base/dev/core/
    sudo docker-compose down
    ```

## Load a single container live

Loading a single container is very useful to test a newly create production service container or to launch the frontend while the backend is being debugged.

You can easily load any container live in your Assemblyline Dev environment by following these instructions:

!!! note
    For this demo we will assume that you want to run the service container from the [developing an Assemblyline service](../../../services/developing_an_assemblyline_service) documentation.

=== "PyCharm Professional"

    1. Click the `Run` menu then select `Edit Configurations...`
    2. Click the `+` button at the top left`
    3. Select "Docker Image"
    4. In the `Name` field at the top, set the name to: `Sample Service - Container`
    5. Set the `Image ID` to: `testing/assemblyline-service-sample`
    6. Set the `Container Name` to SampleService
    7. Click the modify options and select `Environment variables`
    8. Add the following environment variable: `SERVICE_API_HOST=http://172.17.0.1:5003`
    9. Click the modify options and select `Run options`
    10. Add the following `Run option`: `-network host`
    11. Click `OK`

    !!! tip
        From now on you can just select the `Sample Service - Container` run configuration from the dropdown up top and hit the run button to launch it.

=== "Docker (PyCharm Community)"

    Pycharm Community does not have support for managing Docker containers, therefore you will have to run your containers using a `shell`.

    In a new terminal on the VM, run the following commands:
    ```shell
    docker run --env SERVICE_API_HOST=http://172.17.0.1:5003 --network=host --name SampleService testing/assemblyline-service-sample
    ```
    !!! tip
        This will take over the terminal and the logs will be displayed there. Hit ```ctrl-c``` when you want to shut the containers down.

## Run components live from PyCharm

### Core Components

Most of the core components are going to be as easy to run as finding the component main file then hit `Run` or `Debug`... All core components require you to run the ```Minimal Dependencies``` `docker-compose` file before launching them.

!!! example "Launching the API Server"
    1. Find the UI main file in the project files browser
        - ```assemblyline-ui/assemblyline_ui/app.py```
    2. Right-click on it
    3. Select either ```Run 'app'``` or ```Debug 'app'```

### Live Services

The main exception to very easy-to-run components is debugging services live in the system. Services require you to run two separate components to process files. The two components talk via named pipes in the /tmp folder. Inside the Docker container, this is very easy but debugging this live requires some sacrifices.

!!! warning "Limitations"
    1. You can only run one live debugging service at the time.
    2. Depending on where you stop them and how you stop them, they don't fully clean up after themselves.
    3. They require extra configuration, it's not just "click-and-go".

We will show you how to run the Sample service live in the system created in the [developing and Assemblyline service](../../../services/developing_an_assemblyline_service) documentation. This requires you to run the full infrastructure using the `docker-compose` files before executing the steps. ([Minimal dependencies](#minimal-dependencies) and [Core services](#core-services))

!!! important
    Run the following example inside the PyCharm window pointing to the services (`~/git/services`)

!!! example
    Setup `Task Handler` run configuration if it does not exist:

    1. Click the "Run" menu then select "Edit Configurations..."
    2. Click the `+` button at the top left
    3. Click `Python`
    4. The first option in the configuration tab is a drop-down that says `Script path:` click it and choose `Module Name:`
    5. In the box beside it, write: `assemblyline_service_client.task_handler`
    6. In the name box at the top, write `Task Handler`
    7. Click the `OK` Button

    Now if you click the green play button beside the newly created `Task Handler` run configuration, Task Handler will be waiting for the service to start.

    Setup the new service configuration:

    1. Click the "Run" menu then select "Edit Configurations..."
    2. Click the `+` button at the top left
    3. Click `Python`
    4. The first option in the configuration tab is a drop-down that says `Script path:` click it and choose `Module Name:`
    5. In the box beside it, write: `assemblyline_v4_service.run_service`
    6. Add `;SERVICE_PATH=sample.Sample` to the `Environment variables`
    7. Set the working directory to: `assemblyline-service-sample` by pressing the little `folder` on the right and browsing to that directory
    8. In the name box at the top, write `Sample Service - LIVE`
    9. Click `OK`
    10. Now that dropdown near the top says `Sample Service - LIVE`, click the `play` or the `bug` button to either `Run` or `Debug` the service
        - In the Run or Debug window, the service will be stuck at *Waiting for receive task named pipe to be ready...*. This is because task_handler shut down after registering the service for the first time.
    11. Select `task_handler` from the dropdown near the top and click the `play` or `bug` button beside it again.
        - Now both `Sample Service - LIVE` and `Task Handler` will stay up and poll for tasks from the service server.
