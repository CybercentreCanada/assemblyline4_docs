# Service manifest

Every service must have a `service_manifest.yml` file in its root directory. The manifest file presents essential
information about the service to the Assemblyline core system, information the Assemblyline core system must have before
it can run the service.

The table below shows all the elements that the manifest file can contain, including a brief description of each.
