# Classification engine

Assemblyline can do record-based access control for submission, files, results, and even up to individual sections and tags of said results. It was built to support the [Government of Canada levels of security](https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/esc-src/protection-safeguarding/niveaux-levels-eng.html) and the [Traffic Light Protocol](https://www.cisa.gov/tlp) but can also be modified at will.

Once turned on, the classification engine will do the following changes to the system:

* Users will have to be assigned a maximum classification level that they can see as well as the groups they are members of
* Each submission to the system will have to have a classification level
* The User Interface will:
    * Show the effective classification of each submission, file, result, and result sections
    * Have a dedicated help section that will explain how classification conflicts are resolved
    * Let you pick a classification while submitting a file
    * Automatically hide portions of the result for a user that does not have enough privileges to see them

# Configuration

The classification engine has many parameters that can be customized so you can get record-based access controls that fit your organization.

Here is an exhaustive configuration file of the classification engine that explains every single parameter:
???+ example "Exhaustive classification configuration"
    ```yaml
    # Turn on/off classification enforcement. When this flag is off, this
    #  completely disables the classification engine, any documents added while
    #  the classification engine is off getting the default unrestricted value
    enforce: false

    # When this flag is on, the classification engine will automatically create
    #  groups based on the domain part of a user's email address
    #  EX:
    #     For user with email: test@local.host
    #     The group "local.host" will be valid in the system
    dynamic_groups: false

    # List of Classification Levels:
    #   This is a graded list; a smaller number is less restricted than a higher number
    #   A user must be allowed a classification level >= to be able to view the data
    levels:
      # List of alternate names for the current marking. If a user submits a file with
      #  those markings, the classification will automatically rename it to the value
      #  specified in the name
      - aliases:
          - UNRESTRICTED
          - UNCLASSIFIED
          - U

        # Stylesheet applied in the UI for the current classification level
        css:
          # Name of the color scheme used for display
          # Possible values: default, primary, secondary, success, info, warning, error
          color: default

          # Deprecated parameters (Use color instead)
          #  These were used in the old UI but are still valid in the new UI because if
          #  the new UI cannot find the color param, it will use the label param and
          #  strips "label-" part.
          banner: alert-default
          label: label-default
          text: text-muted

    ```

# Enabling it in your system
By default, the classification engine is disabled in the system, but it can easily be enabled by creating a new config map in Kubernetes.

!!! info
    For this documentation we will enable a classification engine that supports only the traffic light protocol.

In your deployment directory, create a file named `objects.yaml` with the following content:
???+ example "objects.yaml"
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: assemblyline-extra-config
    data:
      classification: |
        enforce: true
        levels:
          - aliases:
              - UNRESTRICTED
              - U
            css:
              color: default
            description:
              Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP:WHITE information may be
              distributed without restriction.
            lvl: 100
            name: TLP:WHITE
            short_name: TLP:W
          - aliases: []
            css:
              color: success
            description:
              Recipients may share TLP:GREEN information with peers and partner
              organizations within their sector or community, but not via publicly
              accessible channels. Information in this category can be circulated
              widely within a particular community. TLP:GREEN information may not
              be released outside of the community.
            lvl: 110
            name: TLP:GREEN
            short_name: TLP:G
          - aliases:
              - RESTRICTED
              - R
            css:
              color: warning
            description:
              Recipients may only share TLP:AMBER information with members of their
              own organization and with clients or customers who need to know the
              information to protect themselves or prevent further harm.
            lvl: 120
            name: TLP:AMBER
            short_name: TLP:A

        required: []
        groups: []
        subgroups: []

        restricted: TLP:A
        unrestricted: TLP:W
    ```

Use kubectl to apply the `objects.yaml` file to your system:

=== "Appliance"

    ```shell
    sudo microk8s kubectl apply -f ~/git/deployment/objects.yaml --namespace=al
    ```

=== "Cluster"

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f <deployment_directory>/objects.yaml --namespace=al
    ```

Then you must tell your pods to use the classification engine from the newly created config map. Add the following block to the `values.yaml` or your deployment:

???+ example "Partial values.yaml to load the custom classification.yml file"
    ```yaml
    ...
    coreEnv:
      - name: CLASSIFICATION_CONFIGMAP
        value: assemblyline-extra-config
      - name: CLASSIFICATION_CONFIGMAP_KEY
        value: classification
    coreMounts:
      - name: al-extra-config
        mountPath: /etc/assemblyline/classification.yml
        subPath: classification
    coreVolumes:
      - name: al-extra-config
        configMap:
          name: assemblyline-extra-config
    ...
    ```

Finally update your deployment using `helm upgrade command`:


=== "Appliance"

    ```shell
    sudo microk8s helm upgrade assemblyline ~/git/assemblyline-helm-chart/assemblyline -f ~/git/deployment/values.yaml -n al
    ```

=== "Cluster"

    ```shell
    helm upgrade assemblyline <assemblyline-helm-chart>/assemblyline -f <deployment_directory>/values.yaml -n al
    ```

!!! important
    It takes a while for all the containers to be restarted so be patient and it will eventually show up in the UI.
