    Refer to the [changing the configuration file](../config_file/#changing-the-configuration-file) documentation for more detail on where and how to change the configuration of the system.

## Alerter

The configuration block at `core.alerter` contains all the configuration parameters that the Assemblyline alerter component can take.

Here is an example configuration block with inline comments about the purpose of every single parameters:

???+ example "Alerter configuration example"
    ```yaml
    core:
      alerter:
        # Time to live in days for alerts in the system
        alert_ttl: 90

        # List of fields that should keep the same value in between normal and extended scan
        #  NOTE: You should not have to change those ever, this might get removed in the future
        constant_alert_fields:
        - alert_id
        - file
        - ts

        # Default field to group alerts with in the UI
        default_group_field: file.sha256

        # Delay applied to the alert UI to leave time to the extended scan to complete
        delay: 300

        # List of fields allowed to be used for grouping that are present in every single alerts
        filtering_group_fields:

        - file.md5
        - file.sha1
        - file.sha256

        # Python class used to process alert messages

        expiry:
          # Perform delete operation in batch when changing day instead of throughout the day
          #   NOTE: Not deleting during the day will make the system more responsive during the day
          #         but will significantly reduce performance when changing to a new day until
          #         all delete operations are done.
          batch_delete: false

          # Delay in hours applied to the deletion schedule
          delay: 0

          # Should data expiry operation get rid of files as well?

          #  At the given value sampling will start, and grow gradually more agressive until 3 times
          #  the value given. At 3 times the value given the system will proccess as many files
          #  as possible, and all others will be discarded.

          #  on the score from the previous run.
          stale_after_seconds: 86400

          # File whitelist import path. Imported object will be passed to the 'get_whitelist_verdict'
          #  function. The default verdict function will use this as a file whitelist.
