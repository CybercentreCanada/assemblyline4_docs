# Malware Archive section

Configuring the Malware Archive functionality is done by modifying the data storage section (`datastore:`) and the file storage section (`filestore:`). Refer to the [Malware Archive](../overview/architecture/#keeping-files-forever-malware-archive) to get an understanding of how this feature works.

Enable the `archive:` option in the configuration to show the "Archive" link in the left navbar, activate the Archiver core component and create the archive indices in the database. The `indices:` list defines which indices will have an archive counterpart. This key is not required given its default values of `file`, `submission`, and `result`.

???+ example "Datastore section configuration example"
    ```yaml
    ...
    datastore:
      # Datastore Archive feature configuration
      archive:
        # Are we enabling Achiving features across indices?
        enabled: true

        # List of indices the ILM Applies to
        indices:
        - file
        - submission
        - result

    filestore:
      # List of filestores used for malware archive
      archive:
      - s3://al_storage_key:Ch@ngeTh!sPa33w0rd@localhost:9000?s3_bucket=al-archive&use_ssl=False
    ...
    ```
